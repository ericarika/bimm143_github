## the pdb database

the [protein data bank (pdb)](:http://www.rcsb.org/) is the main
repository of biomolecular structure data. let’s see what is in it:

``` r
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)

## Using Molstar

we can use the main [molstar viwer online](https://molstar.org/viewer/):

let’s try out the new **bio3dview** package that is not yet on CRAN. We
can use the **remotes** package to install any R package from GitHub

``` r
library(NGLVieweR)
library(bio3dview)

sele <- bio3d::atom.select(hiv,resno=25)

#view.pdb(hiv, backgroundColor = "pink",
#         highlight = sele,
#         highlight.style = "spacefill") 
```

## Prediction of Protein flexibility

``` r
library(bio3d)
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

      Note: Accessing on-line PDB file
       PDB has ALT records, taking A only, rm.alt=TRUE

``` r
m <- nma(adk)
```

     Building Hessian...        Done in 0.012 seconds.
     Diagonalizing Hessian...   Done in 0.04 seconds.

``` r
plot(m)
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

Write out our results as a wee trajectory movie:

``` r
mktrj(m, file = "results.pdb")
```

``` r
#view.nma(m, pdb=adk)
```

## comparative protein structure analysis with PCA

we start with a database id “1ake_A”

``` r
#install.packages("httr")

library(bio3d)

id<- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
```

    Warning in get.seq(id): Removing existing file: seqs.fasta

    Fetching... Please wait. Done.

``` r
#blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

have wee a peek:

``` r
#head(blast$hit.tbl)
```

``` r
#hits <- plot(blast)
```

Peal at our “top hits”

``` r
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
head(hits$pdb.id)
```

    [1] "1AKE_A" "6S36_A" "6RZE_A" "3HPR_A" "1E4V_A" "5EJE_A"

Now we can download these “top hits” these will all be ADK structures in
the PDB database

``` r
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split = TRUE, gzip = TRUE)
```

we ned one package from BioConductor. To set this up, we need to first
install a package called **BiocManager** from CRAN

Now we can use the `install()` function from this package like this:
`BiocManager::install("msa")`

``` r
pdbs <- pdbaln(files,fit=TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Let’s have a wee peak at our structures after “fitting” superposing:

``` r
library(bio3dview)
#view.pdbs(pdbs, colorScheme = "residue")
```

we can run functoins like `rmsd()`, `rmsf()`, and the best `pca()`

``` r
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

``` r
plot(pc.xray, 1:2)
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

finally, let’s make a wee movie of the major “motion” or structural
difference in the data set - we call this a “trajectory”

``` r
mktrj(pc.xray, file="results.pdb") 
```

> what is the total number of entries in the PDB

``` r
n.sums["Totals"]
```

    <NA> 
      NA
